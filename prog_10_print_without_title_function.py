# Prog10. title() makes all first letter of each word in the string, capital letter. And all other letter in small case. Create a program that do the same functionality without using title() function.

# ask for user input
user_input = input("Enter a word: ")

# split input into words
words = text.split()
result = ""

# loop each word
# capitalize first letter
# rest to lowercase
# remove the extra space
# print
